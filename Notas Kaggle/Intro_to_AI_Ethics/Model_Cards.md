# Model Cards

A model card is a short document that provides key information about a machine learning model. Model cards increase transparency by communicating information about trained models to broad audiences.

- Who is the audience of your model card?
A model card should strike a balance between being easy-to-understand and communicating important technical information. When writing a model card, you should consider your audience: the groups of people who are most likely to read your model card.
